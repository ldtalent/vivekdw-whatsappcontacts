Points to note before you run the script :- 

1- You must be using python3 to run the code

2- Google chrome and chrome driver version must be same. I have Google chrome of Version 73.0.3683.103 (Official Build) (64-bit) so I downloaded chrome driver accordingly.

3- You can download another version of chrome driver from the link - http://chromedriver.chromium.org/downloads please read my blog for more details on this.

4- I built this code to leverage Google Chrome driver.

5- You must have downloaded Selenium as well. You can use the command - `pip3 install selenium` to download selenium
